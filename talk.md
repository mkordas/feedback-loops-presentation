Good Morning JDD!
I'm so glad to see you all here early in the morning.
My name is Michal and I'm software quality engineer in Luxoft.
I've prepared for you presentation about feedback loops.

So what is feedback? You do a thing and check how it went. As simple as that.
Then you just try to optimize the latency of the entire round trip.

If we look at agile manifesto there's lot about feedback there.
Majority of principles are about getting early and often feedback.

Here is agile manifesto.
What is about feedback here? Not that much.
Much more interesting are agile manifesto principles, which are mostly
about getting early and often feedback.

How many people have already left the room?
Please don't!
This presentation won't be about the soft stuff.
Of course agile, Scrum, Kanban, TDD, BDD help us to make feedback loops faster,
but there is one more super-important principle that is often forgotten:
Technical Excellence!

This talk is about technical practices that my and my team are incorporating
in our projects to make the loops blazingly fast.

A bit of background: we have about two, maybe three dozens of repositories with
Java, Groovy or Scala code that are built using Maven or Gradle.
Jenkins is our CI system and we review our code on GitHub.
